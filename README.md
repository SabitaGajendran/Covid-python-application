This is a simple "Covid report Application" based on python with a simple GUI that I created using the Tkinter module. I used the help of an API to code this application which retrives the required data from the server. The application gives a report based on the name of the country entered. (The total number of cases, No. of recovered cases, confirmed cases and No. of deaths) Since the API is not updated to the current date, the most recent report it can give is of 2020-06-1. I also created an executable for this application using Pyinstaller.
